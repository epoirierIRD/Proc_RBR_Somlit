# Proc_RBR_Somlit
Processing of RBR ctd cast for Somlit coastal observatory in Plouzane, France.
The goal is to create a 'routine' for the RBR maestro data to process the raw binary rsk file and save it to a csv file with the same format and processing that used to be applied to SBE data.
Off course RBR is not SBE and processing will not be the same but result on this intercomparison day must show as little diffrence as possible and csv output file must be just like the SBE ones to be absorbed in the somlit databases.

Emilie did the processing of SBE data
The goal is to do a processing of the profile of the RBR maestro using RSKtools library in python to produce a profile similar as the SBE one and then compare them.


The main reference found on the web for processing RBR CTD data is Halverson et al. 2017.
